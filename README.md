# samplefinder
AmigaOS 3 sound sample previewer. Plays any PCM sample at ProTracker's C-1, C-2, and C-3. Also plays IFF 8SVX samples but only at their native sample rate at the moment. The UI is GadTools so no MUI/ClassAct/ReAction needed.

Requirements to compile
--------------
- VBCC 0.9e and the AmigaOS 3 target

Requirements to run
